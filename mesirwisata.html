            <h1>Gyeongbokgung Palace</h1>
            <p>Established shortly after the foundation of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392, Gyeongbokgung Palace was 
               the first royal palace built in Seoul. The name "Gyeongbokgung" translates to "Palace of Shining 
               Happiness." Throughout its history, the palace has undergone multiple reconstructions due to 
               damages from wars and occupations. Notably, it was destroyed during the Imjin War in 1592 and 
               later reconstructed in the late 19th century under King Gojong's reign.
